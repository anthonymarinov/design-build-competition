# design-build-competition
Design-build competition completed as a term project for SE3 at UC San Diego. Placed 1st out of 46 teams, with a 73% higher score than the 2nd place team.

### Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a structure/mechanism that could take a ball and place it on scoring platforms at least 6 inches away. The mechanism had to be entirely independent of any human interaction and actuated by a servomotor. The project was required to be fully designed in Solidworks, with a complete set of drawings produced in AutoCAD.

### Given
Available materials/resources included:
- 3D printing
- Laser-cut polycarbonate sheets
- Servomotor
- Rubber bands
- Prefabricated plastic beams and connectors
- Steel ball bearings
- Aluminum tube
- Braided thread
- Screws and nuts

---

### Solution
We developed a cascading extending arm mechanism powered by the servomotor. The design consisted of four individual 3D-printed arms connected by pulleys with braided thread, laser-cut claws, structural support, and a ball release mechanism that deployed upon full extension of the arm. Key aspects of the design process included:
- Preliminary servomotor calculations to ensure sufficient torque and rotation range
- Complex Solidworks modeling
- Over 50 hours of 3D printing and 3 hours of laser cutting time

No rubber bands were used in this design, avoiding a significant score deduction based on the scoring criteria.

### Achievements
- **1st Place** out of 46 teams, with a 73% higher score than the 2nd place team.
- The only team with a unique design that avoided using a catapult mechanism and rubber bands.
