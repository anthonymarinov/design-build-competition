# design-build-competition
Design-build competition done as term project for SE3 at UC Can Diego. Placed 1st out of 46 teams, with a 73% higher score than 2nd place.
Purpose | The goal of this project was to create a structure/mechanism that takes a ball and places it on scoring platforms a minimum of 6 inches away. The mechanism must be independent of any human interaction, 
          &emsp;and must be actuated by a servomotor. The project must be complete;y designed in Solidworks, and a full set of drawings must be produced in AutoCAD.<br/>
Given | Available materials/resources include:<br/>
&emsp;- 3D printing<br/>
&emsp;- lazer cut polycarbonate sheets<br/>
&emsp;- servomotor<br/>
&emsp;- rubber bands<br/>
&emsp;- prefabricated plastic beams and connectors<br/>
&emsp;- steel ball bearings<br/>
&emsp;- aluminium tube<br/>
&emsp;- braided thread<br/>
&emsp;- screws and nuts<br/>
Solution | Created a cascading extending arm mechanism driven by the servomotor. It consisted of 4 individual 3D printed arms connected by pulleys with braided thread, lazer cut claws and mechanism structural       &emsp;support, and a ball release mechanism that releases upon full extension of the arm. Achieving this required preliminary servomotor calculations and considerations to make sure the servomotor 
&emsp;had the torque and rotation range to actually power the mechanism, complex solidworks modeling, over 50 hours of 3D printing time, and 3 hours of lazer cutting time. No rubber bands were used in 
&emsp;this design, which were avoided due to carrying a very significant score deduction based on a scoring index.<br/>
Achievements | Scored 1st out of 46 teams, with a 73% higher score than 2nd place. Only team that had a unique design, not building a catapult and not using rubber bands for their design.
